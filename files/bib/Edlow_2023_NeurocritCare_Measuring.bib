    abstract = {Early reemergence of consciousness predicts long-term functional recovery for patients with severe brain injuries. However, tools to reliably detect consciousness in the intensive care unit (ICU) are lacking. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography has the potential to detect consciousness in the ICU, predict recovery, and prevent premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy.},
