    abstract = {The human brain exhibits dynamic interactions among brain regions when responding to stimuli and executing tasks, which can be recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Functional MRI signals collected in response to specific tasks consist of a combination of task-related and spontaneous (task-independent) activity. By exploiting the highly structured spatiotemporal patterns of resting state networks, this paper presents a matched-filter approach to decomposing fMRI signals into task and resting-state components. To perform the decomposition, we first use a temporal alignment procedure that is a windowed version of the brainsync transform to synchronize a resting template to the brain's response to tasks. The resulting 'matched filter' removes the components of the fMRI signal that can be described by resting connectivity, leaving the portion of brain activity directly related to tasks. We present a closed-form expression for the windowed synchronization transform that is used by the matched filter. We demonstrate performance of this procedure in application to motor task and language task fMRI data. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that by removing the resting activity, we are able to identify task activated regions in the brain more clearly. Additionally, we show improved prediction accuracy in multivariate pattern analysis when using the matched filtered fMRI data.},
