    abstract = {Characterizing functional brain connectivity using resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is challenging due to the relatively small Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent contrast and low signal-to-noise ratio. Denoising using surface-based Laplace-Beltrami (LB) or volumetric Gaussian filtering tends to blur boundaries between different functional areas. To overcome this issue, a time-based Non-Local Means (tNLM) filtering method was previously developed to denoise fMRI data while preserving spatial structure. The kernel and parameters that define the tNLM filter need to be optimized for each application. Here we present a novel Global PDF-based tNLM filtering (GPDF) algorithm that uses a data-driven kernel function based on a Bayes factor to optimize filtering for spatial delineation of functional connectivity in resting fMRI data. We demonstrate its performance relative to Gaussian spatial filtering and the original tNLM filtering via simulations. We also compare the effects of GPDF filtering against LB filtering using individual in-vivo resting fMRI datasets. Our results show that LB filtering tends to blur signals across boundaries between adjacent functional regions. In contrast, GPDF filtering enables improved noise reduction without blurring adjacent functional regions. These results indicate that GPDF may be a useful preprocessing tool for analyses of brain connectivity and network topology in individual fMRI recordings.},
