    abstract = {Three methods for the estimation of blood or breath alcohol concentration (BAC/BrAC) from biosensor measured transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) are evaluated and compared. Specifically, we consider a system identification/quasi-blind deconvolution scheme based on a distributed parameter model with unbounded input and output for ethanol transport in the skin and compare it to two more conventional system identification and filtering/deconvolution techniques for ill-posed inverse problems, one based on frequency domain methods and the other on a time series approach using an ARMA input/output model. Our basis for comparison are five statistical measures of interest to alcohol researchers and clinicians: peak BAC/BrAC, time of peak BAC/BrAC, the ascending and descending slopes of the BAC/BrAC curve, and the area underneath the BAC/BrAC curve.},
