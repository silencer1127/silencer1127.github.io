    abstract = {Stereotactically implanted Electro-Encephalography (SEEG) in patients with epilepsy provides a unique insight into spontaneous human brain activity. Exploring dynamic functional connectivity in spontaneous SEEG signals provides a rich framework for studying brain networks. Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for decoding dynamic networks, capturing the intrinsic interactions between multiple dimensions with less restrictive constraints than traditional 2D matrix decomposition methods such as PCA and ICA. Tensor decomposition, however, is seldom used for decoding large resting brain datasets due to its high computational complexity and poor robustness. In this paper, we describe a Scalable and Robust Sequential Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (SRSCPD) framework that can sequentially and robustly identify tensor models of successively higher rank. We demonstrate that SRSCPD is not only more robust than the popular Alternating Least Square (ALS) algorithm, but can also be extended to large-scale problems.},
