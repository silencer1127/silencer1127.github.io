    abstract = {Brain connectivity is modeled as a complex, segregative and integrative network of connections between different brain regions. Studying functional brain connectivity can offer us an effective way to examine how different brain networks relate to human behaviors as well as how those networks may be altered in neurological diseases. However, measuring functional connectivity poses a variety of mathematical, signal processing and neuroscience challenges. First, a good high-level representation of the data is often required in order to obtain an accurate estimation of the functional connectivity, because most of the typically-used linear measures are not capable of capturing the true highly non-linear brain interactions. Second, the temporal stationarity of the time series assumed by most of the studies may not be realistic due to the dynamic nature of the brain. Hence, how to reliably estimate the spatial and temporal dynamics of functional connectivity simultaneously is a key challenge to us. Moreover, signals collected via almost all neuroimaging techniques are heavily corrupted with noise. The inherent low signal-to-noise ratio prevents us from obtaining a robust estimation of functional connectivity. In this work, we present and validate several novel approaches and methods to address some of the challenges in functional connectivity estimation and brain network identification problems. To address the high-level data representation issue, we defined a bio-electrical marker that can differentiate the epileptogenic zone from areas of propagation in patients with epilepsy. We discovered a specific ictal time-frequency pattern, referred as the “fingerprint”, in the epileptogenic zone which contains a combination of sharp spikes preceding multi-band fast activity concurrent with suppression of lower frequencies. We developed a novel machine learning system that automatically extracts each of these features, classifies electrode contacts as being within the epileptogenic zone or outside the epileptogenic zone and generates individualized epileptogenic zone predictions for each patient based on their anatomical magnetic resonance images. To address the dynamic brain network identification issue, we developed a rank-recursive scalable and robust sequential canonical polyadic decomposition framework that allows us to robustly discover brain networks which can overlap in both space and time in large-scale datasets. The robustness and scalability were achieved by using lower-rank solutions as the warm start to higher-rank decompositions. This scalable and robust sequential canonical polyadic decomposition framework is flexible in the sense that it is not only applicable to wavelet-transformed electroencephalography data but also to multi-subject asynchronous functional magnetic resonance imaging data if the data is temporally aligned across subjects using the BrainSync algorithm. To address the noise corruption issue, we described an optimization-based method that provides a means of systematically selecting the parameter for the temporal non-local means filtering. We further developed global PDF-based temporal non-local means, a novel data-driven optimized kernel function based on Bayes factor for the temporal non-local means filtering, which allows us to perform global filtering with improved noise reduction effects but without blurring adjacent functional regions. Applications of these proposed methods are illustrated using a variety of simulated as well as in-vivo clinical data.},
