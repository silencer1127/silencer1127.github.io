    abstract = {Methods for the estimation of blood or breath alcohol concentration (BAC/BrAC) from biosensor measured transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) are developed, evaluated and compared. Specifically, a scheme based on a distributed parameter model with unbounded input and output for ethanol transport in the skin is compared to more conventional filtering/deconvolution techniques, one based on frequency domain methods, and the other on a time series approach using an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) input/output model. Our basis for comparison are five statistics of interest to alcohol researchers and clinicians: peak BAC/BrAC, time of peak BAC/BrAC, the ascending and descending slopes of the BAC/BrAC curve and area underneath the BAC/BrAC curve. It can be shown that the ARMA-based method yields the best estimation of the peak while the distributed parameter model produces the best estimation of the time of the peak. The Fourier-based method has the least variance out of the three and is computationally very efficient.},
