      Objective
We aim to study the correlation between seizure outcomes in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) who underwent laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) and stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) electrophysiologic patterns with respect to the extent of laser ablation.

Methods
We retrospectively analyzed 16 consecutive DRE patients who underwent LITT. A seizure onset zone (SOZ) was obtained from multidisciplinary patient management conferences and again was confirmed independently by two epileptologists based on conventional analysis. SOZ were retrospectively divided into localized, lobar and multilobar, and nonlocalized onset types. A posteriori predicted epileptogenic zone (PEZ) was identified using the previously developed “EZ fingerprint” pipeline. The completeness of the SOZ and PEZ ablation was compared and correlated with the duration of seizure freedom (SF).

Results
Out of 16 patients, 11 had a posteriori-identified PEZ. Three patients underwent complete ablation of SOZ with curative intent, and the other 13 with palliative intent. Out of three patients with complete ablation of the SOZ, two had concordant PEZ and SOZ and achieved 40- and 46-month SF without seizure recurrence. The remaining patient, without any PEZ identified, had seizure recurrence within one month.
Six out of 13 patients with partial ablation of the SOZ and PEZ achieved a mean SF of 19.8 months (range: 1 to 44) with subsequent seizure recurrence. The remaining seven patients had partial ablation of the SOZ without the PEZ identified or ablation outside the PEZ with seizure recurrence within one to two months, except one patient who had 40 months SF after ablation of periventricular heterotopia.

Significance
Only complete ablation of the well-restricted SOZ concordant with the PEZ was associated with long-term SF, whereas partial ablation of the PEZ might lead to SF with eventual seizure recurrence. Failure to identify PEZ and ablation limited to the SOZ often led to one to two months of SF.

      Early reemergence of consciousness predicts long-term functional recovery for patients with severe brain injuries. However, tools to reliably detect consciousness in the intensive care unit (ICU) are lacking. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography has the potential to detect consciousness in the ICU, predict recovery, and prevent premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy.

      The human brain is a complex network that exhibits dynamic fluctuations in activity across space and time. Depending on the analysis method, canonical brain networks identified from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) are typically constrained to be either orthogonal or statistically independent in their spatial and/or temporal domains. We avoid imposing these potentially unnatural constraints through the combination of a temporal synchronization process ("BrainSync") and a three-way tensor decomposition method ("NASCAR") to jointly analyze rs-fMRI data from multiple subjects. The resulting set of interacting networks comprises minimally constrained spatiotemporal distributions, each representing one component of functionally coherent activity across the brain. We show that these networks can be clustered into six distinct functional categories and naturally form a representative functional network atlas for a healthy population. This functional network atlas could help explore group and individual differences in neurocognitive function, as we demonstrate in the context of ADHD and IQ prediction.

      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a widespread mental illness that causes considerable suffering, and neuroimaging studies are trying to reduce this burden by developing biomarkers that can facilitate detection. Prior fMRI- and neurostimulation studies suggest that aberrant subgenual Anterior Cingulate (sgACC)—dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) functional connectivity is consistently present within MDD. Combining the need for reliable depression markers with the electroencephalogram’s (EEG) high clinical utility, we investigated whether aberrant EEG sgACC–DLPFC functional connectivity could serve as a marker for depression. Source-space Amplitude Envelope Correlations (AEC) of 20 MDD patients and 20 matched controls were contrasted using non-parametric permutation tests. In addition, extracted AEC values were used to (a) correlate with characteristics of depression and (b) train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine sgACC–DLPFC connectivity’s discriminative power. FDR-thresholded statistical maps showed reduced sgACC–DLPFC AEC connectivity in MDD patients relative to controls. This diminished AEC connectivity is located in the beta-1 (13–17 Hz) band and is associated with patients’ lifetime number of depressive episodes. Using extracted sgACC–DLPFC AEC values, the SVM achieved a classification accuracy of 84.6% (80% sensitivity and 89.5% specificity) indicating that EEG sgACC–DLPFC connectivity has promise as a biomarker for MDD.

      The intrinsic functional organization of the brain changes into older adulthood. Age differences are observed at multiple spatial scales, from global reductions in modularity and segregation of distributed brain systems, to network-specific patterns of dedifferentiation. Whether dedifferentiation reflects an inevitable, global shift in brain function with age, circumscribed, experience-dependent changes, or both, is uncertain. We employed a multimethod strategy to interrogate dedifferentiation at multiple spatial scales. Multi-echo (ME) resting-state fMRI was collected in younger (n=181) and older (n=120) healthy adults. Cortical parcellation sensitive to individual variation was implemented for precision functional mapping of each participant while preserving group-level parcel and network labels. ME-fMRI processing and gradient mapping identified global and macroscale network differences. Multivariate functional connectivity methods tested for microscale, edge-level differences. Older adults had lower BOLD signal dimensionality, consistent with global network dedifferentiation. Gradients were largely age-invariant. Edge-level analyses revealed discrete, network-specific dedifferentiation patterns in older adults. Visual and somatosensory regions were more integrated within the functional connectome; default and frontoparietal control network regions showed greater connectivity; and the dorsal attention network was more integrated with heteromodal regions. These findings highlight the importance of multiscale, multimethod approaches to characterize the architecture of functional brain aging.

      The presence of outliers can severely degrade learned representations and performance of deep learning methods and hence disproportionately affect the training process, leading to incorrect conclusions about the data. For example, anomaly detection using deep generative models is typically only possible when similar anomalies (or outliers) are not present in the training data. Here we focus on variational autoencoders (VAEs). While the VAE is a popular framework for anomaly detection tasks, we observe that the VAE is unable to detect outliers when the training data contains anomalies that have the same distribution as those in test data. In this paper we focus on robustness to outliers in training data in VAE settings using concepts from robust statistics. We propose a variational lower bound that leads to a robust VAE model that has the same computational complexity as the standard VAE and contains a single automatically-adjusted tuning parameter to control the degree of robustness. We present mathematical formulations for robust variational autoencoders (RVAEs) for Bernoulli, Gaussian and categorical variables. The RVAE model is based on beta-divergence rather than the standard Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed beta-divergence based autoencoder for a variety of image and categorical datasets showing improved robustness to outliers both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also illustrate the use of our robust VAE for detection of lesions in brain images, formulated as an anomaly detection task. Finally, we suggest a method to tune the hyperparameter of RVAE which makes our model completely unsupervised.

      The default mode network (DMN) mediates self-awareness and introspection, core components of human consciousness. Therapies to restore consciousness in patients with severe brain injuries have historically targeted subcortical sites in the brainstem, thalamus, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and basal ganglia, with the goal of reactivating cortical DMN nodes. However, the subcortical connectivity of the DMN has not been fully mapped and optimal subcortical targets for therapeutic neuromodulation of consciousness have not been identified. In this work, we created a comprehensive map of DMN subcortical connectivity by combining high-resolution functional and structural datasets with advanced signal processing methods. We analyzed 7 Tesla resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data from 168 healthy volunteers acquired in the Human Connectome Project. The rs-fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data were temporally synchronized across subjects using the BrainSync algorithm. Cortical and subcortical DMN nodes were jointly analyzed and identified at the group level by applying a novel Nadam-Accelerated SCAlable and Robust (NASCAR) tensor decomposition method to the synchronized dataset. The subcortical connectivity map was then overlaid on a 7 Tesla 100 micron ex vivo MRI dataset for neuroanatomic analysis using automated segmentation of nuclei within the brainstem, thalamus, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and basal ganglia. We further compared the NASCAR subcortical connectivity map with its counterpart generated from canonical seed-based correlation analyses. The NASCAR method revealed that BOLD signal in the central lateral nucleus of the thalamus and ventral tegmental area of the midbrain is strongly correlated with that of the DMN. In an exploratory analysis, additional subcortical sites in the median and dorsal raphe, lateral hypothalamus, and caudate nuclei were correlated with the cortical DMN. We also found that the putamen and globus pallidus are negatively correlated (i.e., anti-correlated) with the DMN, providing rs-fMRI evidence for the mesocircuit hypothesis of human consciousness, whereby a striatopallidal feedback system modulates anterior forebrain function via disinhibition of the central thalamus. Seed-based analyses yielded similar subcortical DMN connectivity, but the NASCAR result showed stronger contrast and better spatial alignment with dopamine immunostaining data. The DMN subcortical connectivity map identified here advances understanding of the subcortical regions that contribute to human consciousness and can be used to inform the selection of therapeutic targets in clinical trials for patients with disorders of consciousness.

      We describe a novel method for robust identification of common brain networks and their corresponding temporal dynamics across subjects from asynchronous functional MRI (fMRI) using tensor decomposition. We first temporally align asynchronous fMRI data using the orthogonal BrainSync transform, allowing us to study common brain networks across sessions and subjects. We then map the synchronized fMRI data into a 3D tensor (vertices × time × subject/session). Finally, we apply Nesterov-accelerated adaptive moment estimation (Nadam) within a scalable and robust sequential Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition framework to identify a low rank tensor approximation to the data. As a result of CP tensor decomposition, we successfully identified twelve known brain networks with their corresponding temporal dynamics from 40 subjects using the Human Connectome Project's language task fMRI data without any prior information regarding the specific task designs. Seven of these networks show distinct subjects’ responses to the language task with differing temporal dynamics; two show sub-components of the default mode network that exhibit deactivation during the tasks; the remaining three components reflect non-task-related activities. We compare results to those found using group independent component analysis (ICA) and canonical ICA. Bootstrap analysis demonstrates increased robustness of networks found using the CP tensor approach relative to ICA-based methods.

      Characterizing functional brain connectivity using resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is challenging due to the relatively small Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent contrast and low signal-to-noise ratio. Denoising using surface-based Laplace-Beltrami (LB) or volumetric Gaussian filtering tends to blur boundaries between different functional areas. To overcome this issue, a time-based Non-Local Means (tNLM) filtering method was previously developed to denoise fMRI data while preserving spatial structure. The kernel and parameters that define the tNLM filter need to be optimized for each application. Here we present a novel Global PDF-based tNLM filtering (GPDF) algorithm that uses a data-driven kernel function based on a Bayes factor to optimize filtering for spatial delineation of functional connectivity in resting fMRI data. We demonstrate its performance relative to Gaussian spatial filtering and the original tNLM filtering via simulations. We also compare the effects of GPDF filtering against LB filtering using individual in-vivo resting fMRI datasets. Our results show that LB filtering tends to blur signals across boundaries between adjacent functional regions. In contrast, GPDF filtering enables improved noise reduction without blurring adjacent functional regions. These results indicate that GPDF may be a useful preprocessing tool for analyses of brain connectivity and network topology in individual fMRI recordings.

      Background: Intracerebral electroencephalography (iEEG) using stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) methodology for epilepsy surgery gives rise to complex data sets. The neurophysiological data obtained during the in-patient period includes categorization of the evoked potentials resulting from direct electrical cortical stimulation such as cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs). These potentials are recorded by hundreds of contacts, making these waveforms difficult to quickly interpret over such high-density arrays that are organized in three dimensional fashion. New Method: The challenge in analyzing CCEPs data arises not just from the density of the array, but also from the stimulation of a number of different intracerebral sites. A systematic methodology for visualization and analysis of these evoked data is lacking. We describe the process of incorporating anatomical information into the visualizations, which are then compared to more traditional plotting techniques to highlight the usefulness of the new framework. Results: We describe here an innovative framework for sorting, registering, labeling, ordering, and quantifying the functional CCEPs data, using the anatomical labelling of the brain, to provide an informative visualization and summary statistics which we call the "FAST graph" (Functional-Anatomical STacked area graphs). The fast graph analysis is used to depict the significant CCEPs responses in patient with focal epilepsy. Conclusions: The novel plotting approach shown here allows us to visualize high-density stimulation data in a single summary plot for subsequent detailed analyses. Improving the visual presentation of complex data sets aides in enhancing the clinical utility of the data.

      The role of fast activity as a potential biomarker in localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) remains controversial due to recently reported unsatisfactory performance. We recently identified a "fingerprint" of the EZ as a time-frequency pattern that is defined by a combination of preictal spike(s), fast oscillatory activity, and concurrent suppression of lower frequencies. Here we examine the generalizability of the fingerprint in application to an independent series of patients (11 seizure-free and 13 non-seizure-free after surgery) and show that the fingerprint can also be identified in seizures with lower frequency (such as beta) oscillatory activity. In the seizure-free group, only 5 of 47 identified EZ contacts were outside the resection. In contrast, in the non-seizure-free group, 104 of 142 identified EZ contacts were outside the resection. We integrated the fingerprint prediction with the subject's MR images, thus providing individualized anatomical estimates of the EZ. We show that these fingerprint-based estimates in seizure-free patients are almost always inside the resection. On the other hand, for a large fraction of the nonseizure-free patients the estimated EZ was not well localized and was partially or completely outside the resection, which may explain surgical failure in such cases. We also show that when mapping fast activity alone onto MR images, the EZ was often over-estimated, indicating a reduced discriminative ability for fast activity relative to the full fingerprint for localization of the EZ.

Severe anemia also predisposes to white matter strokes in young children, independent of the anemia subtype. We previously demonstrated symmetrically decreased white matter (WM) volumes in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). In the current study, we investigated whether patients with non-sickle anemia also have lower WM volumes and cognitive dysfunction. Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed on 52 clinically asymptomatic SCD patients (age=21.4±7.7; F=27, M=25; hemoglobin=9.6±1.6 g/dL), 26 non-sickle anemic patients (age=23.9±7.9; F=14, M=12; hemoglobin=10.8±2.5 g/dL) and 40 control subjects (age=27.7±11.3; F=28, M=12; hemoglobin=13.4±1.3 g/dL). Voxel-wise changes in WM brain volumes were compared to hemoglobin levels to identify brain regions that are vulnerable to anemia. White matter volume was diffusely lower in deep, watershed areas proportionally to anemia severity. After controlling for age, sex, and hemoglobin level, brain volumes were independent of disease. WM volume loss was associated with lower Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ; P=.0048; r2=.18) and an abnormal burden of silent cerebral infarctions (P=.029) in males, but not in females. Hemoglobin count and cognitive measures were similar between subjects with and without white-matter hyperintensities. The spatial distribution of volume loss suggests chronic hypoxic cerebrovascular injury, despite compensatory hyperemia. Neurocognitive consequences of WM volume changes and silent cerebral infarction were strongly sexually dimorphic. Understanding the possible neurological consequences of chronic anemia may help inform our current clinical practices.k

      Three methods for the estimation of blood or breath alcohol concentration (BAC/BrAC) from biosensor measured transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) are evaluated and compared. Specifically, we consider a system identification/quasi-blind deconvolution scheme based on a distributed parameter model with unbounded input and output for ethanol transport in the skin and compare it to two more conventional system identification and filtering/deconvolution techniques for ill-posed inverse problems, one based on frequency domain methods and the other on a time series approach using an ARMA input/output model. Our basis for comparison are five statistical measures of interest to alcohol researchers and clinicians: peak BAC/BrAC, time of peak BAC/BrAC, the ascending and descending slopes of the BAC/BrAC curve, and the area underneath the BAC/BrAC curve.

      Objective: Identification of networks from resting brain signals is an important step in understanding the dynamics of spontaneous brain activity. We approach this problem using a tensor-based model. Methods: We develope a rank-recursive scalable and robust sequential canonical polyadic decomposition (SRSCPD) framework to decompose a tensor into several rank-1 components. Robustness and scalability are achieved using a warm start for each rank based on the results from the previous rank. Results: In simulations we show that SRSCPD consistently outperforms the multistart alternating least square (ALS) algorithm over a range of ranks and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), with lower computation cost. When applying SRSCPD to resting in-vivo stereotactic EEG (SEEG) data from two subjects with epilepsy, we found components corresponding to default mode and motor networks in both subjects. These components were also highly consistent within subject between two sessions recorded several hours apart. Similar components were not obtained using the conventional ALS algorithm. Conclusion: Consistent brain networks and their dynamic behaviors were identified from resting SEEG data using SRSCPD. Significance: SRSCPD is scalable to large datasets and therefore a promising tool for identification of brain networks in long recordings from single subjects.

      We describe a patient with unilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) and drug-resistant epilepsy, whose SEEG revealed that seizures were arising from the PNH, with the almost simultaneous involvement of heterotopic neurons ("micronodules") scattered within the white matter, and subsequently the overlying cortex. Laser ablation of heterotopic nodules and the adjacent white matter rendered the patient seizure free. This case elucidates that “micronodules” scattered in white matter between heterotopic nodules and overlying cortex might be another contributor in complex epileptogenicity of heterotopia. Detecting patient-specific targets in the epileptic network of heterotopia creates the possibility to disrupt the pathological circuit by minimally invasive procedures.

      We describe BrainSync, an orthogonal transform that allows direct comparison of resting fMRI (rfMRI) time-series across subjects. For this purpose, we exploit the geometry of the rfMRI signal space to propose a novel orthogonal transformation that synchronizes rfMRI time-series across sessions and subjects. When synchronized, rfMRI signals become approximately equal at homologous locations across subjects. The method is based on the observation that rfMRI data exhibit similar connectivity patterns across subjects, as reflected in the pairwise correlations between different brain regions. We show that if the data for two subjects have similar correlation patterns then their time courses can be approximately synchronized by an orthogonal transformation. This transform is unique, invertible, efficient to compute, and preserves the connectivity structure of the original data for all subjects. Analogously to image registration, where we spatially align structural brain images, this temporal synchronization of brain signals across a population, or within-subject across sessions, facilitates cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of rfMRI data. The utility of the BrainSync transform is illustrated through demonstrative simulations and applications including quantification of rfMRI variability across subjects and sessions, cortical functional parcellation across a population, timing recovery in task fMRI data, comparison of task and resting state data, and an application to complex naturalistic stimuli for annotation prediction.

      Defining a bio-electrical marker for the brain area responsible for initiating a seizure remains an unsolved problem. Fast gamma activity has been identified as the most specific marker for seizure onset, but conflicting results have been reported. In this study, we describe an alternative marker, based on an objective description of interictal to ictal transition, with the aim of identifying a time-frequency pattern or 'fingerprint' that can differentiate the epileptogenic zone from areas of propagation. Seventeen patients who underwent stereoelectroencephalography were included in the study. Each had seizure onset characterized by sustained gamma activity and were seizure-free after tailored resection or laser ablation. We postulated that the epileptogenic zone was always located inside the resection region based on seizure freedom following surgery. To characterize the ictal frequency pattern, we applied the Morlet wavelet transform to data from each pair of adjacent intracerebral electrode contacts. Based on a visual assessment of the time-frequency plots, we hypothesized that a specific time-frequency pattern in the epileptogenic zone should include a combination of (i) sharp transients or spikes; preceding (ii) multiband fast activity concurrent; with (iii) suppression of lower frequencies. To test this hypothesis, we developed software that automatically extracted each of these features from the time-frequency data. We then used a support vector machine to classify each contact-pair as being within epileptogenic zone or not, based on these features. Our machine learning system identified this pattern in 15 of 17 patients. The total number of identified contacts across all patients was 64, with 58 localized inside the resected area. Subsequent quantitative analysis showed strong correlation between maximum frequency of fast activity and suppression inside the resection but not outside. We did not observe significant discrimination power using only the maximum frequency or the timing of fast activity to differentiate contacts either between resected and non-resected regions or between contacts identified as epileptogenic versus non-epileptogenic. Instead of identifying a single frequency or a single timing trait, we observed the more complex pattern described above that distinguishes the epileptogenic zone. This pattern encompasses interictal to ictal transition and may extend until seizure end. Its time-frequency characteristics can be explained in light of recent models emphasizing the role of fast inhibitory interneurons acting on pyramidal cells as a prominent mechanism in seizure triggering. The pattern clearly differentiates the epileptogenic zone from areas of propagation and, as such, represents an epileptogenic zone 'fingerprint'.
