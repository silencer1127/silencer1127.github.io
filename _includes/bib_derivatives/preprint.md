      Neuromodulation of subcortical network hubs by pharmacologic, electrical, or ultrasonic stimulation is a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). However, optimal subcortical targets for therapeutic stimulation are not well established. Here, we leveraged 7 Tesla resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data from 168 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project to map the subcortical connectivity of six canonical cortical networks that modulate higher-order cognition and function: the default mode, executive control, salience, dorsal attention, visual, and somatomotor networks. Based on spatiotemporally overlapped networks generated by the Nadam-Accelerated SCAlable and Robust (NASCAR) tensor decomposition method, our goal was to identify subcortical hubs that are functionally connected to multiple cortical networks. We found that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain and the central lateral (CL) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei of the thalamus – regions that have historically been targeted by neuromodulatory therapies to restore consciousness – are subcortical hubs widely connected to multiple cortical networks. Further, we identified a subcortical hub in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum that overlapped with multiple reticular and extrareticular arousal nuclei and that encompassed a well-established "hot spot" for coma-causing brainstem lesions. Multiple hubs within the brainstem arousal nuclei and thalamic intralaminar nuclei were functionally connected to both the DMN and SN, emphasizing the importance of these cortical networks in integrative subcortico-cortical signaling. Additional subcortical connectivity hubs were observed within the caudate head, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, regions classically associated with modulation of cognition, behavior, and sensorimotor function. Collectively, these results suggest that multiple subcortical hubs in the brainstem tegmentum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and medial temporal lobe modulate cortical function in the human brain. Our findings strengthen the evidence for targeting subcortical hubs in the ventral tegmental area, central lateral thalamus, and pontomesencephalic tegmentum to restore consciousness in patients with DoC. We release all subcortical connectivity maps to support ongoing efforts at therapeutic neuromodulation of consciousness.

      Subcortical arousal systems are known to play a key role in controlling sustained changes in attention and conscious awareness. Recent studies indicate that these systems have a major influence on short-term dynamic modulation of visual attention, but their role across sensory modalities is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated shared subcortical arousal systems across sensory modalities during transient changes in attention using block and event-related fMRI paradigms. We analyzed massive publicly available fMRI datasets collected while 1,561 participants performed visual, auditory, tactile, and taste perception tasks. Our analyses revealed a shared circuit of subcortical arousal systems exhibiting early transient increases in activity in midbrain reticular formation and central thalamus across perceptual modalities, as well as less consistent increases in pons, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and basal ganglia. Identifying these networks is critical for understanding mechanisms of normal attention and consciousness and may help facilitate subcortical targeting for therapeutic neuromodulation.

      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, yet the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are incompletely understood. This gap in knowledge is in part related to the lack of analytic methods to account for cortical lesions in prior neuroimaging studies. The objective of this study was to develop a lesion detection tool and apply it to an investigation of longitudinal changes in brain structure among individuals with chronic TBI. We identified 24 individuals with chronic moderate-to-severe TBI enrolled in the Late Effects of TBI (LETBI) study who had cortical lesions detected by T1-weighted MRI at two time points. Initial MRI scans were performed more than 1-year post-injury and follow-up scans were performed 3.1 (IQR=1.7) years later. We leveraged FreeSurfer parcellations of T1-weighted MRI volumes and a recently developed super-resolution technique, SynthSR, to identify cortical lesions in this longitudinal dataset. Trained raters received the data in a randomized order and manually corrected the automated lesion segmentation, yielding a final lesion mask for each scan at each timepoint. Lesion volume significantly increased between the two time points with a median volume change of 3.2 (IQR=5.9) mL (p<0.001), and the increases significantly exceeded the possible variance in lesion volume changes due to manual tracing errors (p < 0.001). Lesion volume significantly expanded longitudinally in 23 of 24 subjects, with all FDR corrected p-values ≤ 0.02. Inter-scan duration was not associated with the magnitude of lesion growth. We also demonstrated that the semi-automated tool showed a high level of accuracy compared to “ground truth” manual lesion segmentation. Semi-automated lesion segmentation is feasible in TBI studies and creates opportunities to elucidate mechanisms of post-traumatic neurodegeneration.

      Cortical parcellation has long been a cornerstone in the field of neuroscience, enabling the cerebral cortex to be partitioned into distinct, non-overlapping regions that facilitate the interpretation and comparison of complex neuroscientific data. In recent years, these parcellations have frequently been based on the use of resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. In parallel, methods such as independent components analysis have long been used to identify large-scale functional networks with significant spatial overlap between networks. Despite the fact that both forms of decomposition make use of the same spontaneous brain activity measured with rsfMRI, a gap persists in establishing a clear relationship between disjoint cortical parcellations and brain-wide networks. To address this, we introduce a novel parcellation framework that integrates NASCAR, a three-dimensional tensor decomposition method that identifies a series of functional brain networks, with state-of-the-art graph representation learning to produce cortical parcellations that represent near-homogeneous functional regions that are consistent with these brain networks. Further, through the use of the tensor decomposition, we avoid the limitations of traditional approaches that assume statistical independence or orthogonality in defining the underlying networks. Our findings demonstrate that these parcellations are comparable or superior to established atlases in terms of homogeneity of the functional connectivity across parcels, task contrast alignment, and architectonic map alignment. Our methodological pipeline is highly automated, allowing for rapid adaptation to new datasets and the generation of custom parcellations in just minutes, a significant advancement over methods that require extensive manual input. We describe this integrated approach, which we refer to as Untamed, as a tool for use in the fields of cognitive and clinical neuroscientific research. Parcellations created from the Human Connectome Project dataset using Untamed, along with the code to generate atlases with custom parcel numbers, are publicly available at https://untamed-atlas.github.io.
