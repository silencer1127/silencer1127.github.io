      The intrinsic functional connectome can reveal how a lifetime of learning and lived experience is represented in the functional architecture of the aging brain. We investigated whether network dedifferentiation, a hallmark of brain aging, reflects a global shift in network dynamics, or comprises network-specific changes that reflect the changing landscape of aging cognition. We implemented a novel multi-faceted strategy involving multi-echo fMRI acquisition and de-noising, individualized cortical parcellation, and multivariate (gradient and edge-level) functional connectivity methods. Twenty minutes of resting-state fMRI data and cognitive assessments were collected in younger (n=181) and older (n=120) adults. Dimensionality in the BOLD signal was lower for older adults, consistent with global network dedifferentiation. Functional connectivity gradients were largely age-invariant. In contrast, edge-level connectivity showed widespread changes with age, revealing discrete, network-specific dedifferentiation patterns. Visual and somatosensory regions were more integrated within the functional connectome; default and frontoparietal regions showed greater coupling; and the dorsal attention network was less differentiated from transmodal regions. Associations with cognition suggest that the formation and preservation of integrated, large-scale brain networks supports complex cognitive abilities. However, into older adulthood, the connectome is dominated by large-scale network disintegration, global dedifferentiation and network-specific dedifferentiation associated with age-related cognitive change.

      Machine learning methods often need a large amount of labeled training data.Since the training data is assumed to be the ground truth, outliers can severelydegrade learned representations and performance of trained models. Here we applyconcepts from robust statistics to derive a novel variational autoencoder that isrobust to outliers in the training data. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) extract alower-dimensional encoded feature representation from which we can generatenew data samples. Robustness of autoencoders to outliers is critical for generatinga reliable representation of particular data types in the encoded space when usingcorrupted training data. Our robust VAE is based on beta-divergence rather than thestandard Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Our proposed lower bound lead to aRVAE model that has the same computational complexity as the VAE and contains a single tuning parameter to control the degree of robustness. We demonstrate theperformance of our beta-divergence based autoencoder for a range of image datasets,showing improved robustness to outliers both qualitatively and quantitatively. Wealso illustrate the use of our robust VAE for outlier detection.
