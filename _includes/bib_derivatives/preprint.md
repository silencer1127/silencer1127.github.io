      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, yet the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are incompletely understood. This gap in knowledge is in part related to the lack of analytic methods to account for cortical lesions in prior neuroimaging studies. The objective of this study was to develop a lesion detection tool and apply it to an investigation of longitudinal changes in brain structure among individuals with chronic TBI. We identified 24 individuals with chronic moderate-to-severe TBI enrolled in the Late Effects of TBI (LETBI) study who had cortical lesions detected by T1-weighted MRI at two time points. Initial MRI scans were performed more than 1-year post-injury and follow-up scans were performed 3.1 (IQR=1.7) years later. We leveraged FreeSurfer parcellations of T1-weighted MRI volumes and a recently developed super-resolution technique, SynthSR, to identify cortical lesions in this longitudinal dataset. Trained raters received the data in a randomized order and manually corrected the automated lesion segmentation, yielding a final lesion mask for each scan at each timepoint. Lesion volume significantly increased between the two time points with a median volume change of 3.2 (IQR=5.9) mL (p<0.001), and the increases significantly exceeded the possible variance in lesion volume changes due to manual tracing errors (p < 0.001). Lesion volume significantly expanded longitudinally in 23 of 24 subjects, with all FDR corrected p-values ≤ 0.02. Inter-scan duration was not associated with the magnitude of lesion growth. We also demonstrated that the semi-automated tool showed a high level of accuracy compared to “ground truth” manual lesion segmentation. Semi-automated lesion segmentation is feasible in TBI studies and creates opportunities to elucidate mechanisms of post-traumatic neurodegeneration.

      Cortical parcellation has long been a cornerstone in the field of neuroscience, enabling the cerebral cortex to be partitioned into distinct, non-overlapping regions that facilitate the interpretation and comparison of complex neuroscientific data. In recent years, these parcellations have frequently been based on the use of resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. In parallel, methods such as independent components analysis have long been used to identify large-scale functional networks with significant spatial overlap between networks. Despite the fact that both forms of decomposition make use of the same spontaneous brain activity measured with rsfMRI, a gap persists in establishing a clear relationship between disjoint cortical parcellations and brain-wide networks. To address this, we introduce a novel parcellation framework that integrates NASCAR, a three-dimensional tensor decomposition method that identifies a series of functional brain networks, with state-of-the-art graph representation learning to produce cortical parcellations that represent near-homogeneous functional regions that are consistent with these brain networks. Further, through the use of the tensor decomposition, we avoid the limitations of traditional approaches that assume statistical independence or orthogonality in defining the underlying networks. Our findings demonstrate that these parcellations are comparable or superior to established atlases in terms of homogeneity of the functional connectivity across parcels, task contrast alignment, and architectonic map alignment. Our methodological pipeline is highly automated, allowing for rapid adaptation to new datasets and the generation of custom parcellations in just minutes, a significant advancement over methods that require extensive manual input. We describe this integrated approach, which we refer to as Untamed, as a tool for use in the fields of cognitive and clinical neuroscientific research. Parcellations created from the Human Connectome Project dataset using Untamed, along with the code to generate atlases with custom parcel numbers, are publicly available at https://untamed-atlas.github.io.

      Consciousness is comprised of arousal (i.e., wakefulness) and awareness. Substantial progress has been made in mapping the cortical networks that modulate awareness in the human brain, but knowledge about the subcortical networks that sustain arousal is lacking. We integrated data from ex vivo diffusion MRI, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo 7 Tesla functional MRI to map the connectivity of a subcortical arousal network that we postulate sustains wakefulness in the resting, conscious human brain, analogous to the cortical default mode network (DMN) that is believed to sustain self-awareness. We identified nodes of the proposed default ascending arousal network (dAAN) in the brainstem, hypothalamus, thalamus, and basal forebrain by correlating ex vivo diffusion MRI with immunohistochemistry in three human brain specimens from neurologically normal individuals scanned at 600-750 micron resolution. We performed deterministic and probabilistic tractography analyses of the diffusion MRI data to map dAAN intra-network connections and dAAN-DMN internetwork connections. Using a newly developed network-based autopsy of the human brain that integrates ex vivo MRI and histopathology, we identified projection, association, and commissural pathways linking dAAN nodes with one another and with cortical DMN nodes, providing a structural architecture for the integration of arousal and awareness in human consciousness. We release the ex vivo diffusion MRI data, corresponding immunohistochemistry data, network-based autopsy methods, and a new brainstem dAAN atlas to support efforts to map the connectivity of human consciousness.
