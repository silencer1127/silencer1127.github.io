      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a widespread mental illness that causes considerable suffering, and neuroimaging studies are trying to reduce this burden by developing biomarkers that can facilitate detection. Prior fMRI- and neurostimulation studies suggest that aberrant subgenual Anterior Cingulate (sgACC) – dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) functional connectivity is consistently present within MDD. Combining the need for reliable depression markers with the electroencephalogram’s (EEG) high clinical utility, we investigated whether aberrant EEG sgACC–DLPFC functional connectivity could serve as a marker for depression. Source-space Amplitude Envelope Correlations (AEC) of 20 MDD patients and 20 matched controls were contrasted using non-parametric permutation tests. In addition, extracted AEC values were used to a) correlate with characteristics of depression and b) train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine sgACC–DLPFC connectivity’s discriminative power. FDR-thresholded statistical maps showed reduced sgACC–DLPFC AEC connectivity in MDD patients relative to controls. This diminished AEC connectivity is located in the beta-1 (13–17Hz) band and is associated with patients’ lifetime number of depressive episodes. Using extracted sgACC–DLPFC AEC values, the SVM achieved a classification accuracy of 84.6% (80% sensitivity and 89.5% specificity) indicating that EEG sgACC–DLPFC connectivity has promise as a biomarker for MDD.

      The human brain is a complex, integrative and segregative network that exhibits dynamic fluctuations in activity across space and time. A canonical set of large-scale networks has been historically identified from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), including the default mode, visual, somatomotor, salience, attention, and executive control. However, the methods used in identification of these networks have relied on assumptions that may inadvertently constrain their properties and consequently our understanding of the human connectome. Here we define a brain "network" as a functional component that jointly describes its spatial distribution and temporal dynamics, where neither domain suffers from unrealistic constraints. Using our recently developed BrainSync algorithm and the Nadam-Accelerated SCAlable and Robust (NASCAR) tensor decomposition, we identified twenty-three brain networks using rs-fMRI data from a large group of healthy subjects acquired by the Human Connectome Project. These networks are spatially overlapped, temporally correlated, and highly reproducible across two independent groups and sessions. We show that these networks can be clustered into six distinct functional categories and naturally form a representative functional network atlas for a healthy population. Using this atlas, we demonstrate that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder display disproportionate brain activity increases, relative to neurotypical subjects, in visual, auditory, and somatomotor networks concurrent with decreases in the default mode and higher-order cognitive networks. Thus, this work not only yields a highly reproducible set of spatiotemporally overlapped functional brain networks, but also provides convergent evidence that individual differences in these networks can be used to explain individual differences in neurocognitive functioning.
