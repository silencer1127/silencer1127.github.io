      Cortical parcellation has long been a cornerstone in the field of neuroscience, enabling the cerebral cortex to be partitioned into distinct, non-overlapping regions that facilitate the interpretation and comparison of complex neuroscientific data. In recent years, these parcellations have frequently been based on the use of resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. In parallel, methods such as independent components analysis have long been used to identify large-scale functional networks with significant spatial overlap between networks. Despite the fact that both forms of decomposition make use of the same spontaneous brain activity measured with rsfMRI, a gap persists in establishing a clear relationship between disjoint cortical parcellations and brain-wide networks. To address this, we introduce a novel parcellation framework that integrates NASCAR, a three-dimensional tensor decomposition method that identifies a series of functional brain networks, with state-of-the-art graph representation learning to produce cortical parcellations that represent near-homogeneous functional regions that are consistent with these brain networks. Further, through the use of the tensor decomposition, we avoid the limitations of traditional approaches that assume statistical independence or orthogonality in defining the underlying networks. Our findings demonstrate that these parcellations are comparable or superior to established atlases in terms of homogeneity of the functional connectivity across parcels, task contrast alignment, and architectonic map alignment. Our methodological pipeline is highly automated, allowing for rapid adaptation to new datasets and the generation of custom parcellations in just minutes, a significant advancement over methods that require extensive manual input. We describe this integrated approach, which we refer to as Untamed, as a tool for use in the fields of cognitive and clinical neuroscientific research. Parcellations created from the Human Connectome Project dataset using Untamed, along with the code to generate atlases with custom parcel numbers, are publicly available at https://untamed-atlas.github.io.

      Surface-based cortical registration is an important topic in medical image analysis and facilitates many downstream applications. Current approaches for cortical registration are mainly driven by geometric features, such as sulcal depth and curvature, and often assume that registration of folding patterns leads to alignment of brain function. However, functional variability of anatomically corresponding areas across subjects has been widely reported, particularly in higher-order cognitive areas. In this work, we present JOSA, a novel cortical registration framework that jointly models the mismatch between geometry and function while simultaneously learning an unbiased population-specific atlas. Using a semi-supervised training strategy, JOSA achieves superior registration performance in both geometry and function to the state-of-the-art methods but without requiring functional data at inference. This learning framework can be extended to any auxiliary data to guide spherical registration that is available during training but is difficult or impossible to obtain during inference, such as parcellations, architectonic identity, transcriptomic information, and molecular profiles. By recognizing the mismatch between geometry and function, JOSA provides new insights into the future development of registration methods using joint analysis of the brain structure and function.

      Consciousness is comprised of arousal (i.e., wakefulness) and awareness. Substantial progress has been made in mapping the cortical networks that modulate awareness in the human brain, but knowledge about the subcortical networks that sustain arousal is lacking. We integrated data from ex vivo diffusion MRI, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo 7 Tesla functional MRI to map the connectivity of a subcortical arousal network that we postulate sustains wakefulness in the resting, conscious human brain, analogous to the cortical default mode network (DMN) that is believed to sustain self-awareness. We identified nodes of the proposed default ascending arousal network (dAAN) in the brainstem, hypothalamus, thalamus, and basal forebrain by correlating ex vivo diffusion MRI with immunohistochemistry in three human brain specimens from neurologically normal individuals scanned at 600-750 micron resolution. We performed deterministic and probabilistic tractography analyses of the diffusion MRI data to map dAAN intra-network connections and dAAN-DMN internetwork connections. Using a newly developed network-based autopsy of the human brain that integrates ex vivo MRI and histopathology, we identified projection, association, and commissural pathways linking dAAN nodes with one another and with cortical DMN nodes, providing a structural architecture for the integration of arousal and awareness in human consciousness. We release the ex vivo diffusion MRI data, corresponding immunohistochemistry data, network-based autopsy methods, and a new brainstem dAAN atlas to support efforts to map the connectivity of human consciousness.
