## Research Summary
Li's research interests lie in the application of statistical signal and image processing and machine learning theory to modeling and analysis of biomedical data. Of particular recent interest, he is focusing on the development of computational methods for analysis and inference of brain connectivity using data from a variety of spatio-temporal imaging modalities, such as stereotactic electro-encephalography (SEEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
