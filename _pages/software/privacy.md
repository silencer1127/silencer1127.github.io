## Personal Information

When you use our downloading service, you will be asked to fill in your **name**, **affiliation** and **e-mail address**. In addition, we record the **IP address** and the **browser** (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, IE, etc.) you used to visit our website. We use all information described above to generate a unique ID/link (hashing) for each request and that link will be sent to the e-mail address you provided in the download page. The e-mail sent to you will only contain your name and the download link.

We implement this strategy to prevent our server from random crawling, attacking, hacking (yes, that happens frequently :( ). We do not sell, trade or transfer your personal information (e.g. name, e-mail address, etc.) to any other party outside. However, we may release your information when appropriate to comply with the law.

## Information Security and Disclosure

We understand the importance of the safety of your personal information. We have implemented several security measures, from both the client side and the server side, to protect your personal information from unauthorized access. Sending a unique download link to your e-mail address described above is one of the many measures we implemented.

## FAQs

- My download link expired, what happened?

Another security measure we implemented. Your personal download link sent to your e-mail address will be valid for 3 times within an hour since your request. If your download link is expired, just request another one again from [here](/software/).

- I don't want to provide my real name/affiliation/e-mail, can I still download?

Yes, you can use your nickname, your cat's name, or anything sounds like a name. Leaving the field empty won't work (robots often do that). Similarly for the affiliation field, but we encourage you to put your actual affiliation, or even an abbreviation, which will help us better understand the demography of our users. However, you must provide a valid e-mail address, to which the download link is going to be sent. If you don't want to provide your personal e-mail either, you can register a fresh e-mail account (e.g. Gmail) for this purpose, if that doesn't bother you. You are **not bound to any real personal information** in order to proceed with downloading. Even in case you put your real name/affiliation/e-mail in (most people do), we do not release any of them unless required by law.

## Consent

By using our downloading web service, you consent to the privacy policy described above. Any further change of the privacy policy will be posted on this page.
