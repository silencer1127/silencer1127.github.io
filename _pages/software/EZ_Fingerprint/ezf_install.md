## Uninstallation

Do **NOT** uninstall EZF using the MATLAB icon as shown above. Due to the incompatibility of the MATLAB APP management and our online installation mechanism, uninstallation using the MATLAB default method will result in some file/directory left-overs. Moreover, it will prevent you from installing EZF again in the future.

Instead, you can use the "Uninstall" button under the "Misc" tab to perform a **complete** uninstalltion. See details [here](/software/EZ_Fingerprint/tutorial/ezf_misc#uninstall).
