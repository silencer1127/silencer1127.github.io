# **<center>Nadam-accelerated Scalable and Robust CP Decomposition</center>**

## Introduction

Tensor decompositions is a generalization of matrix decompostions in three or higher-dimensional space. One of the most widely used model is the canonical polyadic (CP) form, also known as parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) or canonical decomposition (CANDECOMP). Unlike applying the independent component analysis (ICA) or the principal component analysis (PCA) on the matricized / unfolded data for brain network identification, the CP decomposition can capture the low rank struture inherit in the higher-dimensional data. Moreover, it does not need to impose any constraint (in order to have a unique solution), such as independence in ICA or orthogonality in PCA, which may not be realistic as brain networks can overlap and be correlated in both space and time.

**N**adam-**A**ccelerated **SCA**lable and **R**obust CP Decomposition (NASCAR) is a pipeline for brain network identification across multiple subjects from asynchronous function magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We first used [BrainSync](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/neuro/Resources/BrainSync){:target="biglab_brainsync"} ([Joshi et al. 2018](/files/bib/Joshi_2018_NeuroImage_Are.bib)) to align fMRI time-series across subjects. As with our earlier work, we used a [Scalable and Robust Sequential Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (SRSCPD)](/software/SRSCPD_ALS/srscpd_als_main) framework, where lower rank solutions were used as a warm-start initialization. Inside SRSCPD, we applied Nesterov-accelerated adaptive moment estimation (Nadam) (Dozat, 2016) to a full-gradient search to simultaneously estimate all components of the CP model, to further improve its robustness and scalability.
